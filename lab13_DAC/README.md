# lab13_DAC

## Purpose

This lab has these major objectives:
- to learn about DAC conversion; 
- to understand how digital data stored in a computer could be used to represent sounds and music;
- to study how the DAC  and interrupts can be used together to create sounds.


## System Requirements / assignment

Most digital music devices rely on high-speed DACs to create the analog waveforms required to produce high-quality sound. In this lab, you will create a very simple sound generation system that illustrates this application of the DAC. Your goal is to create an embedded system that plays four notes, which will be a digital piano with four keys.
