# EmbeddedSystems-ShapeTheWorld

This is a collection of the assignments done through the labs in the course 'Embedded Systems - Shape The World'

The course is split into 2 parts:

      Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output
      - Introduction to the world of embedded systems with a focus on 
      microcontroller input/output in this hands-on, lab-based course.

      Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing
      - Build real-world embedded solutions using a bottom-up approach
      from simple to complex in this hands-on, lab-based course.


Assignments are made in the IDE ‘ARM Keil uVision’. Assignments consisted of a simulator and working with a TM4C123 Tiva LaunchPAD from Texas Instruments and additional lab kit


## PART 1

Concepts covered in part 1:

      0) Understanding how the computer stores and manipulates data,
      1) The understanding of embedded systems using modular design and abstraction,
      2) C programming: considering both function and style,
      3) The strategic use of memory,
      4) Debugging and verification using a simulator and on the real microcontroller,
      5) How input/output using switches, LEDs, stepper motors, and serial ports,
      6) The implementation of an I/O driver using busy-wait synchronization,
      7) Understanding how local variables and parameters work,
      8) Simple motors (e.g., open stepper motor control),

## PART 2

Concepts covered in part 2:

      0) The understanding of embedded systems using modular design and abstraction,

      3) The implementation of an I/O driver using interrupt synchronization,
      4) Multithreaded programming using interrupts ,
      5) Analog to digital conversion (ADC), periodic sampling,
      6) DC motors and closed-loop motor control,
      7) Digital to analog conversion (DAC), used to make simple sounds, Design and implementation of elementary data structures.
      8) Introduction to the Internet of Things using wifi.
