# EmbeddedSystems-ShapeTheWorld

This is a collection of the assignments done through the labs in the course 'Embedded Systems - Shape The World'

The course is split into 2 parts:
- Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output
- Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing


Assignments are made in the IDE ‘ARM Keil uVision’. Assignments consisted of a simulator and working with a TM4C123 Tiva LaunchPAD from Texas Instruments and additional lab kit
